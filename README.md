# Deepfake-Detection
# Abstract:
In the field of deepfake detection, several convolutional neural network (CNN) structures are used to distinguish the manipulated media. Some of the widely used models include Xception, Inception, EfficientNet, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet models which are well known to perform well in image classification tasks. The inclusion of self-attention layers in these models has been proved effective due to their ability to concentrate on certain areas that are crucial in the input data thus increasing detection efficiency. The integration or removal of self-attention layers was found to have a direct impact on the capacity to identify these artifacts added during the development of deep fake videos, making it an important factor to consider when designing a model for accurate deep fake identification. The impact of self-attention layer changes based on its position in the architecture. Out of all the models experimented, Mobilenet with self-attention layer at position 2 standout to be best with accuracy of 98%
